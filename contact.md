#Jekyll is a great tool to create static sites but with static site, there's no backend to send your data to: that is why it's hard to put #a form on a Jekyll site.

#Here listed some resources which provide  a saas service as a backend for forms (contact forms, hiring forms, etc.) to designers and #developers like you:
#1. [Formspree (also open source, free)](https://formspree.io/)
#2. [FormKeep](https://formkeep.com/guides/contact-form-jekyll)
#3. [Simple Form](https://getsimpleform.com/)

<form method="POST" action="https://formspree.io/goodfellasSDSU@gmail.com">
  <input type="email" name="email" placeholder="Your email">
  <textarea name="message" placeholder="Test Message"></textarea>
  <button type="submit">Send Test</button>
</form>

#[Go to the Home Page]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }})
